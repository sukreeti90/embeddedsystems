The format specifier is used during input and output. It is a way to tell the compiler what type of data is in a variable during taking input using scanf() or printing using printf(). Some examples are %c, %d, %f, etc.
The format specifier in printf() and scanf() are mostly the same but there is some difference which we will see. 

printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, â€¦)
This function prints the character on standard output and returns the number of character printed the format is a string starting with % and ends with conversion character (like c, i, f, d, etc.). 
Between both, there can be elements governing the printing format. Below is its description 

A minus(-) sign tells left alignment.
A number after % specifies the minimum field width to be printed if the characters are less than the size of width the remaining space is filled with space and if it is greater than it printed as it is without truncation.
A period( . ) symbol separate field width with the precision.
